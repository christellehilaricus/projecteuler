## Project Euler

The **project Euler** began the October 5th, 2001, as a category on MathsChallenge.net. This initiative is born with Colin Hughes, as a way to honor the work of **Leonard Euler**, a pioneer Swiss mathematician and physician.

The project Euler contains a multitude of programming problems: from the easiest to the hardest. There are more than 500 problems nowadays ! The purpose for a developer is to provide a simple and efficient algorithm for all the so-called problems.

> Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
