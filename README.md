# Project Euler

## \#1 Introduction

The project Euler began the October 5th, 2001, as a category on [mathschallenge.net](http://mathschallenge.net/). This initiative is born with **Colin Hughes**, as a way to honor the work of **Leonhard Euler**, a pioneer Swiss mathematician and physician. It contains more than 500 programming problems: some are easy to decrypt, others require several days of thinking. The real purpose for a developer is to provide a simple and efficient algorithm for all problems. If this developer wants to play the game properly, he must find the solution with a code running in less than a minute !

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*« Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skills will be required to solve most problems. »* [\*](https://projecteuler.net/about)

This repository is my own interpretation of the projet Euler problems. You will find all the solutions written in JavaScript -my favorite language- with an ounce of ES6 (fat arrows `=>`, etc.).
